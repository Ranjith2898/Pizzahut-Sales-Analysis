# 🍕 Pizzahut Sales Analysis (SQL-Based Project)

## 📌 About the Project
This **SQL-based project** analyzes **Pizzahut sales data**, focusing on order details, pizza types, and customer preferences. The database is structured to support insights into **sales trends, revenue generation, and popular pizza choices**.

## 📂 Database Schema & Tables
The database consists of four key tables:
1. **orders** – Contains details like order ID, date, and time.
2. **order_details** – Tracks individual pizza sales with quantity information.
3. **pizzas** – Stores pricing and size details for each pizza.
4. **pizza_types** – Defines pizza categories, ingredients, and names.

📌 **Schema Diagram**  
The **Schema Diagram (`Schema_diagram.png`)** visually represents the relationships between these tables.
